# ML-LinearRegression-LogisticRegression
Linear Regression and Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent


Here I 've implemented Linear Regression and Logistic Regression on data example,
which Andrew Ng explained in his course in 2011. with a friendly and easy way to start with Machine Learning.

Libraries I 've used:
- numpy  v1.23.3
- pandas  v1.5.0
- matplotlib  v3.6.2
- scipy  v1.9.3
